This is a short script to generate PathPlanner JSON files using Canny edge detection.
Images have to be upside down to display correctly on PathPlanner. 

Usage: 
- Change image_path in generate.py to your image path, should place in same dir as generate.py
- Change generate.json in generate.py to your PathPlanner path (you may need to rename the .path to .json for it to work)
- Run python3 generate.py
